# ProGuard / R8 rules for Schnell Verkaufen
# Keep Flutter and plugin entry points (usually handled by default templates).
# Add additional keep rules here if you use reflection-heavy libraries that get stripped.

# Example (uncomment if needed):
# -keep class com.google.gson.** { *; }
# -keep class androidx.annotation.Keep
